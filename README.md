This project applies and compares machine learning models on similar datasets obtained from the
UCI machine learning repository, related to presence/absence prediction of heart diseases in patients. The
models applied were Logistic Regression, Decision Trees (Random Forest) and Neural Networks. The results were obtained by varying
parameters/evaluation metrics for different models. The evaluation Metrics were: Accuracy, Misclassification Error, Cross Validation, ROC. The goal of the project was to
check the model consistency on the datasets and find the
best suited algorithm for that particular dataset. Results obtained had
Logistic Regression and Decision Tree working well for 2 datasets and Neural Networks worked well for one dataset when
compared with Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.

Datasets picked were: Cleveland, Statlog and SPECT from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html
